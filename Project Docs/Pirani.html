  <h1>Edwards PR10S Restoration</h1>

  <p1>A few months back, continuing some high vacuum experiments, I needed a way to quantitate just how much vacuum I was pulling. Looking online, I found various different gauges from different manufacturers, at various different price points. I settled on an Airserco model 9044 gauge with a 9022 transducer. Months of "using" it (trying to get a reading) later, and I finally gave up and bought a different gauge on Ebay. Little did I know, I would be opening yet another can of worms.</p1>
  <p1>Only after I had bought it (seller gave me a considerable discount and I jumped, arguably too early), I started looking into documentation and schematics. Much to my amazement, I found (what I thought) was the correct schematic:</p1>

  <p1>Having had a confident look at the schematic and identifying it as a wheatstone bridge with two adjustments, one for compensation, and one for heater current(?), I connected what I thought was power and ground, gave it 12v, and promptly unplugged it after I heard a bang. Opening it up for further investigation, and I found a melted resistor. I replaced said resistor (it was the 47.5R), and actually thought before proceeding. Luckily I didnt melt the compensator coil...</p1>

  <p1>Checking the board itself, I noticed some features such as the rounded traces that made me think it was older than I had originally made it out to be. After sending an email to Edwards, this suspicion was confirmed. In fact, Edwards support found it in the 1976 catalog of gauges.</p1>

  <p1>Regardless of its age, the transducer tube was in decent shape (intact filament), so I persisted. My next best bet was to reverse engineer the board, and so I did, tracing it in inkscape.</p1>

  <p1>Taking from this, I traced back every connection and created a schematic with the pin diagrams to the connector and the corresponding wire colors on paper. Looking at this configuration, I was able to take a reasonable guess as to where to apply power to: a.) not burn the filament out b.) not destroy resistors, and c.) power the entire bridge and not just one leg. Attaching a current regulated supply this time, with 5v for testing, only the transducer tube heats up, and as expected at atmospheric, I measured close to 0v across the other two legs of the bridge, which is correct (bridge is balanced at atmospheric). Success! Right..? Not yet.</p1>

  <p1>When I was purchasing the tube, in my sheer excitement to finally find what I wanted for a reasonable price, I neglected to look at what the gauge's fitting was. When I recieved it, I noticed it resembled a KF16 vacuum fitting in diameter and angle, but the flange was significantly thicker to accomodate for threading, something I hadnt seen before on a fitting of this type. Talking to Edwards support, we were able to figure out that this was an SC-10 screwed coupling (also shown in the catalog from '76).</p1>

  <p1>Unfortunately, this SC-10 fitting doesnt seem to exist on online marketplaces.</p1>

  <p1>Now I need to make an adapter... the list of things to do grows ever longer.</p1>
